# WebAssembly Blackjack

This is a simple BlackJack game I made by compiling Rust into WebAssembly. It was created using [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) and [create-wasm-app](https://github.com/rustwasm/create-wasm-app).


You can try it out [here](http://ec2-54-152-110-202.compute-1.amazonaws.com/).
